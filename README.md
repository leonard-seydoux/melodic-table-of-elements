# The interactive periodic table of elements

This repository is an artistic project that turns the periodic table of elements into an interactive musical instrument. No description needed, just try it at https://leonard-seydoux.github.io/melodic-table-of-the-elements/. The project aims at evolving, so feel free to contribute! 

One notable issue is the click sound that may appear when the pointer leaves and re-enters the element before the fade-out of the sound. This is due to the fact that the sound is stopped and restarted when the pointer leaves and re-enters the element. I tried to have an "emergency" fade-out of the sound when the pointer leaves and re-enters the element, but it did not work. If you have any idea on how to solve this issue, please let me know!
