# The interactive periodic table of elements

This repository is an artistic project that turns the periodic table of elements into an interactive musical instrument. No description needed, just try it at https://leonard-seydoux.github.io/melodic-table-of-elements/. The project aims at evolving, so feel free to contribute! 

## How to sonify the periodic table of elements

Each sound are made from the different features of the periodic table, like the period or the group (see the script [make_sounds.py](make_sounds.py) for more information). 

The sounds are created from a fundamental frequency, and overtones that are multiples of the fundamental frequency. The fundamental frequency f of a given period is obtained from 

    fundamental_frequency = element_period * f0

where f0 is the lowest fundamental frequency. The overtones are obtained from

    overtone = element_group * fundamental_frequency

After sine-wave generation, the sounds are shaped with a Tukey window, and an exponential decay in order to mimick the attack and decay of instruments. The sound is saved as a WAV file, and then converted to an MP3 file using ffmpeg.

Several overtones are added depending on the block of the element. The d-block elements have one overtone, the f-block elements have two overtones, and the p-block elements have three overtones. The amplitude of the overtones is reduced as the overtone number increases.

Finally, the waveform is shaped with a Tukey window, with an exponential decay to reduce the volume over time. The sound is saved as a WAV file, and then converted to an MP3 file using ffmpeg.

## Potential improvements

One notable issue is the click sound that may appear when the pointer leaves and re-enters the element before the fade-out of the sound. This is due to the fact that the sound is stopped and restarted when the pointer leaves and re-enters the element. I tried to have an "emergency" fade-out of the sound when the pointer leaves and re-enters the element, but it did not work. If you have any idea on how to solve this issue, please let me know!
