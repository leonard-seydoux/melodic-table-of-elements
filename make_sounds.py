"""Create the sounds to be played on hover over the element.

This script creates as many sounds as elements in the periodic table. Each sound are made from the different features of the periodic table, like the period or the group. 

The sounds are created from a fundamental frequency, and overtones that are multiples of the fundamental frequency. The fundamental frequency f of a given period is obtained from 

    fundemental_frequency = period * f0

where f0 is the lowest fundamental frequency. The overtones are obtained from

    overtone = group * fundemental_frequency

After sine-wave generation, the sounds are shaped with a Tukey window, and an exponential decay in order to mimick the attack and decay of instruments. The sound is saved as a WAV file, and then converted to an MP3 file using ffmpeg.

Several overtones are added depending on the block of the element. The d-block elements have one overtone, the f-block elements have two overtones, and the p-block elements have three overtones. The amplitude of the overtones is reduced as the overtone number increases.

Finally, the waveform is shaped with a Tukey window, with an exponential decay to reduce the volume over time. The sound is saved as a WAV file, and then converted to an MP3 file using ffmpeg.

Notes
-----
The units of the different parameters are as follows:
- Frequencies are in Hz.
- Times are in seconds.

This script requires the following packages:
- numpy
- scipy
- pandas (in elements.py)
- ffmpeg (to convert the WAV files to MP3)
